write express backend app
app name: task management
task details: write code for task management app and rest services, dont write ejs and views
it is not mvc app, rest service app, 
running on port localhost:3001, will be accessed by webapp from localhost:3002
enable cors accordingly
task details are stored as data/db.json, if not there, create it initially with empty json array

tech design:
add loggers for every flow
every code should have first line as comment for file name with relevant sub directory structure
every js file should have first line as comment for file name: src/{filename.js}
dir structure:
backend/<express-app-files>
Example: first line of app.js is : backend/src/app.js, follow for remaining files for relative paths
write package.json 

write frontend app with html, css, jquery
features: 
every code should have first line as comment for file name with relevant sub directory structure
dir structure
frontend/index.html
frontend/html/<remaining-html-files>
frontend/css/styles.css
frontend/js/page-wise-scripts.js
frontend/js/any-utils.js
Example: first line of index.html is : frontend/index.html, follow for remaining files for relative paths
bootstrap 5, ui should be profession and neat
Always follow UI design principles: mobile friendly and desktop friendly and forms should not be too wide to occupy fill width of laptop screen
use jquery ajax to connect backend  
make ajax call as common method and access from all places
home page should display all tasks for today, 
also display backlog tasks which were not completed so far
create task option
add navbar for all addition options and features
all tasks page should display all tasks with pagination with html bordered table
all tasks page table grid should have option to mark task as completed if it is not completed already 


data:
task: id, name, status, created_on,
